# Pig Game 🎲

A simple, interactive dice game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS — developed as part of my frontend learning journey. This project showcases event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic game logic implementation.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Two players take turns rolling a single dice.
- On each roll, the number rolled is added to the current player's **current score**.
- If a player rolls a 1, their **current score** is reset to 0 and the turn switches to the other player.
- Players can choose to **hold** (add their **current score** to their **total score**), then the turn switches.
- The first player to reach or exceed **100 points** wins the game.

## ✨ Features

- Dynamic dice roll with images representing dice faces
- Score tracking for both current and total points
- Player turn switching on rolling a 1 or holding
- Visual cues to indicate the active player and the winner
- Responsive UI for easy play
